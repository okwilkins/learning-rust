Revival of Code is a Python Discord hosted event where we revisit old Advent of Code puzzles from a previous year. The puzzles start off easy and gradually get more difficult while revealing a fun little story. Questions will be posted every other day, and you'll be able to discuss your solutions in the thread attached to the bot message.

**What is Advent of Code and why are we revisiting it?**
Advent of Code is a set of small programming puzzles, released from December 1st - 25th each year. These puzzles are a great way to challenge yourself and try out your programming skills in a community setting. So great in fact, that weâ€™re revisiting older puzzles.

If you have any questions or want to discuss the event in general, come talk about it in [Revival of Code Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/267624335836053506/354619224620138496/1006713658723799060).
